 For transfers:
   - everything is under /opt/transferTests on srv-c2c07-16 and mrg-c2f13-37-01. The script to be launched is watchAndInject.py with the parameter "-p /store/lustre/macroMerger", but take a look inside before actually launching it. The original idea was to have it automatically transfer everything it finds under the path, but since we'd be transferring mostly junk, the runs to be transferred are hardcoded inside. By this evening I might turn that into a parameter if I have the time, but not sure. So please just take a look at the script before launching it, it's very simple and straightforward to understand.  I've been running the actual transfers rather from the srv not to disturb the minidaq merger, but it should not really matter
   - when launching it watch on the same machine that the copyworker is actually handling the files: in /store/copyworker/Logs/CopyManager/CopyWorker_<date>.log you should see entries from the RFCP telling you it has succesfully copied the files over. If instead you only see entries of the type :
        Thu Jul 31 09:12:31 2014: LHC status: MACHINE_MODE => 'PROTON PHYSICS', BEAM_MODE => 'STABLE BEAMS', CLOCK_STABLE => 'true'
        Thu Jul 31 09:13:31 2014: LHC status: MACHINE_MODE => 'PROTON PHYSICS', BEAM_MODE => 'STABLE BEAMS', CLOCK_STABLE => 'true'
        Thu Jul 31 09:14:17 2014: Got SetID = 1
   restart the copyworker service - statistically speaking I've noticed this is particularly important in the morning, when a restart of the service changes the log file to the new dat - must be some "feature".
